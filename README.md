# Disk Access Point Cloud – Data Conversion Utility
Overview

This project was developed as part of a university assignment.
It provides simple Python scripts for converting structured Excel data into .txt format for further processing.

The project focuses on basic data transformation and file handling in Python.

Features

Reads structured data from Excel files

Converts data into plain text (.txt) format

Includes multiple conversion modes:

Full dataset export

Limited/filtered export

Handles structured tabular data formatting

Project Structure

convert_excel_to_txt.py – Base conversion script

convert_excel_to_txt_full.py – Exports full dataset

convert_excel_to_txt_limited.py – Exports a limited or filtered subset

Technologies Used

Python

Likely libraries: pandas, openpyxl (depending on your implementation)

Purpose

The goal of this project was to practice:

File I/O in Python

Data transformation workflows

Working with structured datasets

Script modularization

How to Run

Install dependencies (if required):

pip install pandas openpyxl


Run the desired script:

python convert_excel_to_txt_full.py


Adjust file paths inside the script as needed.

Notes

This project was developed for learning purposes and demonstrates basic data preprocessing techniques in Python.
